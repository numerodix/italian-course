# Notes

1. "macchina in marcia" just means that the car is moving.
1. The principal meaning of "correre" is "to run", but it also means speeding 
in a car.
1. "sto per chiamare" ~ "I'm about to call", "sta per scappare" ~ 
"he's about to escape". in general "stare per" with a verb means that someone is
just about to do something.
1. "bisogna" is used as a common way to state a requirement, very similar to
"ci vuole": "bisogna pagare le tasse" ~ "one has to pay taxes" / 
"taxes must be paid".

# Theory: The present continuous

There are two very similar tenses that can be used to describe something that
happens in the present:

- Lavo i piatti. ~ I wash the dishes.
- Sto lavando i piatti. ~ I am washing the dishes.

The first, which we have until now called "the present", is called "the simple 
present", and describes something that happens on a regular basis. 

The second is called the "present continuous", and describes something that is
happening *right now*.

The difference between them is not always important and in Italian the present
continuous is used far less than in English (as evidenced by the fact that we
have seen plenty of present tense, but we have not seen this one until now.)

Examples:

- stai correndo ~ you are speeding
- ci stanno sorpassando ~ they are overtaking us
- stiamo correndo ~ we are speeding

The present continuous is formed with the verb "stare" and what is called
"the gerund":

- Io sto leggendo. ~ I am reading.
- Tu stai leggendo. ~ You are reading.
- Lui/lei sta leggendo. ~ He/she is reading.
- Noi stiamo leggendo. ~ We are reading.
- Voi state leggendo. ~ You are reading. (you guys)
- Loro stanno leggendo. ~ They are reading.
