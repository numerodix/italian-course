# Notes

1. Saying just "Champions" instead of "Champions League" is one of many examples 
of how the language/culture deals with English names in a quirky way.
1. "Monaco" is the name for Munchen, because Munchen has sounds that an Italian 
cannot pronounce. 
Many foreign names of this kind have been italianized, like Stuttgart - "Stoccarda".
1. "si è fatto male" ~ "he hurt himself"/"he injured himself". This is another
reflexive verb, "farsi" ~ "to do to oneself". 
The non-reflexive "fare": "faccio colazione" ~ "I eat breakfast" [do breakfast].
1. l'ha rimpiazzato = lo ha rimpiazzato. Because the "h" is silent, an Italian will
hear two successive vowels and thus join the words.
1. l'hanno = lo hanno.

# Theory: The past tense

In the first episodes we only saw verbs in the present tense. Now we are
beginning to see the past tense too:

- ho ricevuto ~ "I have received" [have received]
- hai visto ~ "have you seen" [have seen]
- si è fatto male ~ "he has hurt himself" [himself is done bad]
- l'ha rimpiazzato ~ "he replaced him" [him-has replaced]
- ha dimenticato ~ "he forgot" [has forgotten]
- l'hanno impedito ~ "they have prevented it" [it-have prevented]
- hanno sbagliato ~ "they have messed up" [have messed-up]

You will notice that in the normal translation to English there is a mixture
between two tenses: "did" and "have done". But in the literal translation
in brackets it is always "have done". The "did" tense is called the preterite
and is not used the same way in Italian, where it is called "il passato remoto"
~ "the remote past". It is usually only used to talk about things in the distant
past.

All the examples above are composed with one of the two verbs essere and avere,
of which avere is more common. This is also the case in the language at large.

The past tense is made up of two parts:

- essere/avere in the present tense: ho / sono
- the past participle: fatto / avuto / stato / giocato

Putting them together makes:

- ho fatto ~ I have done [have done]
- ho avuto ~ I have had [have had]
- sono stato ~ I have been [am been]
- ho giocato ~ I have played [have played]
