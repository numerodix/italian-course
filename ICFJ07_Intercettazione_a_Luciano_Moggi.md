# Notes

1. To emphasize that one is talking about the time, "ore" is used to signal
that what is coming next is a time of day. There is no "o'clock" equivalent.
1. "Pronto?" is the standard way to answer the phone. It basically means 
"you can speak, I am ready to listen" and is spoken in the tone of a question
even though it's not a question.

# Theory: Numbers

Numbers can be quite dense, because they are written (and spoken) without any 
spaces in them:

- duemiladieci - due mila dieci ~ two thousands ten
- millenovecentonovantotto - mille nove cento novant-otto ~
 thousand nine hundred ninety-nine

In general it is common in the language that words become joined with an
apostrophe or fused together whenever there are vowels on both ends. This
also happens with numbers:

- ventuno (venti + uno) ~ twenty one
- ventotto (venti + otto) ~ twenty eight
