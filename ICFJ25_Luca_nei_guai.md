# Notes

1. "fidanzata"/"fidanzato" strictly speaking means fiancé, but the more
common meaning is girlfriend/boyfriend.
1. Since there is no verb for "should", "dovere" is often used both to mean
"must" and "should". Especially in the conditional it means should, so 
"dovrei dormire" ~ "I should sleep".
1. "essemmesse" is a shortened version that is more easy to pronounce, it
ought actually be said as "esse-emme-esse".
1. "mia figlia", not "la mia figlia". Articles are not used with family members,
but they are with other persons: "la mia dottoressa" ~ "my doctor".
