# Notes

1. Adjectives often end in -issimo for effect, like "grandissimo". It just means
"molto grande" ~ "very big".
1. "gol" is the same in singular and plural. "un gol" ~ "a goal", 
"sei gol" ~ "six goals". This is always the case with words that 
end in a consonant: "sette film" ~ "seven movies", or 
with an accented vowel: "cento opportunità" ~ "[a] hundred opportunities".
1. The infinitive of "si nasconde" is "nascondersi" and this is a reflexive verb,
which means that the action performed (hiding) is directed at oneself (hiding oneself).
The non-reflexive "nascondere": "Mexes nasconde le chiavi" ~ "Mexes hides the keys".
1. "sentiamo" ~ "[we] hear" is in the present. The present tense is often used where
in English the future tense is used, by simplying adding "più tardi" ~ "later",
"domani" ~ "tomorrow" etc.

# Theory: Adjective follows noun

An adjective is a word that describes some quality of a thing: a big house, 
a funny joke.

We have seen many examples of adjectives, and in most cases the adjective comes
after the noun:

- il nuovo attaccante ~ the new attacker
- una Ferrari blu ~ a blue Ferrari [a Ferrari blue]
- la sicurezza stradale ~ the road safety [the safety road]
- errore clamoroso ~ dramatic error [error dramatic]
- grandissima partita ~ great match
- autogol stupendo ~ amazing own-goal [own-goal amazing]

This is also the case generally, apart from a few exceptions like "nuovo",
"vecchio" ~ "old", "grande" ~ "big", "piccolo" ~ "small", which may also appear
in front of the verb.
