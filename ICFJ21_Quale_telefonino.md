# Notes

1. "cosa ne pensi?" = "che cosa ne pensi?" = "che ne pensi?". "cosa" with or without
"che", or "che" alone, are variants that are quite interchangeable when asking a 
question.
1. "telefonino" is what is called a diminutive. It's a modification of the word
"telefono" to make it sound more endearing. As a matter of convention, "telefono"
means telephone in general and "telefonino" means cell phone (a handset).
1. The formulation here is "I, in your place, would take...". This way of
 constructing a sentence is quite common.
1. "non me ne frega" ~ "I don't care", "chi se ne frega?" ~ "who cares?".

# Theory: The conditional tense

The tenses we have seen so far have to do either with what *is*
happening, with what *has* happened, or with what *will* happen. What
they have in common is that they present information that is
unconditional, ie. either it already occurs/occurred, or it definitely
will occur.

The conditional is used to talk about a possible future rather than a
certain future. The event presented as possible is based on a condition
that must be met, hence the name conditional. Example:

- If I were rich, I would buy a car.

The condition "I am rich" produces the future event "I will buy a car".

The conditional, as the future tense, is formed with conjugation. Also this
conjugation is quite regular and we will see **parlare** again:

- io parle**rei** ~ I would talk
- tu parle**resti** ~ you would talk
- lui/lei parle**rebbe** ~ he/she would talk
- noi parle**remmo** ~ we would talk
- voi parle**reste** ~ you would talk (you guys)
- loro parle**rebbero** ~ they would talk
